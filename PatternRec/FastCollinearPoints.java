// FastCollinearPoints.java
// Checks 4 points to see if they lie on the same line segment
// For Algorithms, Part I course
// Specifications from: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html
// by Eric Mancini

// Corner case info: Should work even with 5 or more collinear points
// Performance requirement: n^2 log(n) at worst runtime, n plus line segments returned space
