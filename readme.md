Coded by Eric Mancini 

## Notes:

// Compile: javac-algs4 [FileName].java
// Run: java-algs4 [FileName]

*Windows Java install:*

(1) get the SDK
(2) fix the path variable for javac

*Run a java program:*
(1) Be sure the SDK is installed 
(2) javac YourAppName.java
(3) java -cp . YourAppNameWithNoExtension

(the cp stands for class path, the dot means current directory, and has to do with modularization/including)
